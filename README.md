# Leveraging Predictive Analytics and Environmental Factors for Optimized Inventory Management in the Pharmaceutical Industry
1.1 Introduction
The pharmaceutical industry plays a pivotal role in safeguarding public health by ensuring the timely availability of medications. However, maintaining effective inventory management continues to pose significant challenges due to regulatory compliance, fluctuating demand, and the need to minimize waste. Inefficient inventory control can result in stockouts of critical medications or excessive overstocking, leading to financial losses and inefficiencies that adversely impact patient care (Owczarek, 2021).

This project takes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating external environmental factors, such as weather patterns and seasonal illnesses, into inventory demand forecasting. For instance, a demand spike in flu medication during colder months or increased antibiotic requirements during rainy seasons can be predicted more accurately when such external variables are considered. By leveraging advanced predictive analytics and machine learning techniques, this initiative seeks to revolutionize pharmaceutical inventory management by bridging the gap between operational needs and environmental influences (Rushton, Lorraine, Tiong, Karim, Dixon, Greenshields, Marotti, and Breta√±a, 2023).

Drawing inspiration from successful predictive analytics applications in other industries, such as the FMCG sector's use of gradient boosting models and the retail sector's ensemble learning techniques (Venkatasubbu, Rambabu, and Jeyaraman, 2022), this project extends these innovations to meet the unique demands of the pharmaceutical sector. Unlike other industries, the pharmaceutical field faces the added complexity of tracking expiration dates, managing demand for life-saving medications, and adhering to strict regulatory standards (Bashar, Taher, and Johura, 2024; Suwignjo, Panjaitan, Baihaqy, and Rusdiansyah, 2023).

The final deliverable will be a visually rich dashboard tailored to support the pharmaceutical industry. This initiative aims not only to optimize inventory management practices but also to significantly improve healthcare outcomes by proactively addressing demand fluctuations influenced by environmental factors.

1.2 Aims
To create an advanced predictive analytics solution that integrates environmental factors such as weather patterns and seasonal illnesses with historical sales and demand data to enhance pharmaceutical inventory management. The project aims to ensure the timely availability of essential medicines while minimizing waste, reducing costs, and improving healthcare outcomes.

1.3 Objectives
